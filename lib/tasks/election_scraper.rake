# Algorithm Steps:
# open up first link:
# loop through each row in the wiki table
# visit each election year hyperlink
# open up that link and scrape data about election and nominees
# This script can be run through the terminal: "rake scrape_election_results"
# .elections_states tr:nth-child(1) tr
# .elections_states:nth-child(2) (for older elections)
# .elections_states:nth-child(1) (for newer ones)
